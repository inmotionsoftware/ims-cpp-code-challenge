# Part 2

We need to continue our experiement for several more generations. Can you simulate the genes after `40 generations`? 

With the sample data, the most common element is `F` (occurring 2256478763324 times) and the least common element is `J` (occurring 53927705034 times); subtracting these produces `2202551058290`.

## Input Data

Our starting example was a good warm up exercice, but now it's time to work with a more complicated data set.

Click [here](https://github.com/inmotionsoftware/ims-cpp-code-challenge/blob/generator/index.html) to generate your input.

Take your input data and try to apply `40` generations of pair insertion to the gene template and find the most and least common genes in the result. 

**What do you get if you take the quantity of the most common gene and subtract the quantity of the least common gene?**

Can't make it in `40` generations, how many generations can you reasonably run?

Please submit your answer along with your sample data and code.

## The Code

Your code should be written in clear, clean, standard `C++` free of memory leaks and other errors. It should be easy to read and performant, and demonstrate a solid grasp of the language. Use standard container types as much as possible. It should be free of compile warnings, with no external dependencies. It should compile on either `GCC`, `Clang`, or `MSVC`. Bonus points if it compiles on all 3.
